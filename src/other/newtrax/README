A track will be generated, based on an input file. For instance,
"trk1" was the input file for "track1".

Edit the output file to adjust lighting and background color
(use the existing tracks as a model).


The structure of the input file is:

n1 t1
n2 t2
....
....

where t1, t2, ... are types of track elements and n1, n2, ... are
the numbers of times each track element is repeated.

The types of track elements are:

0 - straight, horizontal
1 - 22.5 degrees right, horizontal
2 - 45 degrees right, horizontal
3 - 22.5 degrees left, horizontal
4 - 45 degrees left, horizontal
5 - straight, slope 2:25
6 - straight, slope 4:25
7 - straight, slope 6:25
8 - straight, slope -2:25
9 - straight, slope -4:25
10 - straight, slope -6:25
11 - tunnel start, horizontal
12 - tunnel, horizontal
13 - tunnel end, horizontal
14 - bridge start, slope 6:25
15 - bridge, horizontal
16 - bridge end, slope -6:25
17 - bridge, slope 6:25
18 - bridge, slope -6:25
19...24 - different types of loops
25 - corkscrew clockwise
26 - corkscrew anti-clockwise
27 - straight, slope 1:1
28 - straight, slope 1:2
